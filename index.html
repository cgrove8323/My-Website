<h1>The Reading List</h1>

<p>I enjoy reading in my free time. I love to hear stories about people from
   all different places, in this world and in others. Whether they are real or
   not, if it has some sort of emotional expression and a somewhat happy
   ending, I'm happy. So if you find youself just wandering for a new book to
   read, check out my list below!</p>

<h2>Reading List</h2>

<img src="A_Man_Called_Ove.jpg" class="left">
<p>Author: Fredrik Backman<br>Recommended Age: 14+</p>
<p class="review">This book is my new all-time favorite! Set in Sweden, the home country of
  this author, a disgruntled middle-aged man lives alone, shaped by the sad
  events of his past. When a new family moves in nextdoor, they, along with
  other members of his community, help save Ove from the depths of depression.
  This book shows how Ove's past has transformed him into a grumpy old man, and
  the qualities of his personality that have been covered up by the tragedies
  which haunt his past. The relationships between the characters in this book
  are so real and, because it is set in present day, the personalities and
  situations which Ove encounters are the kinds that we are likely to encounter
  in our own societies today. Plus, the backstory of Ove's childhood really
  pulls on the hearstrings, but at the same it can apply to many different
  people, including myself. I cannot recommend this book enough. It is just an
  absolutely incredible story. Take the time to read it and you'll find
  yourself relating to the characters in all kinds of ways, possibly finding a
  new perspective along the way.</p><br>

<p>Author: Fredrik Backman<br>Recommended Age: 8+</p>
<p class="review">This second Fredrick Backman novel is an emotional story
  about a young girl, Elsa, and her grandmother, who constantly tells her
  stories about a magical land where all dreams and imagination come from.
  After her grandmother passes away, Elsa is sent on a quest to deliver messages
  to people who her grandmother felt she had wronged. Through this experience,
  Elsa grows closer to her mother and the people in their apartment building,
  learning how they are all connected because of the effect Elsa's grandmother
  had on their lives. This story is a great read for anyone who, like me, loves
  to remember the fantasies and dreams that we had when we were little kids.
  Just like in Backman's other books, the emotional connections between these
  characters are so well expressed that they are almost tangible. The way they
  are all connected through the memory of Elsa's grandmother is incredibly
  genuine and unlike any common feeling. As you read, you'll find yourself
  beginning to care about these characters and maybe even feel an emotional
  connection to them, even though they are all fictional. This is how strong
  Backman's writing style is, and I can guarantee that you will enjoy every
  minute spent reading this book!</p>

<img src="The_Girl_Who_Could_Fly.jpg" class="left">
<p>Author: Victoria Forester<br>Recommended Age: 10+</p>
<p class="review">I read this novel for the first time in the 6th grade, and
  absolutely loved it. It's about this girl who was born with the ability to
  fly. The novel describes her strruggles with concealing this extremely unusual
  talent, and, once it is revealed to the public, her experience in a private
  school for children with extraordinary abilities like hers. Unfortunately, she
  later discovers that the facility she attends is not what she thouught it was.
  As she attempts to escape with her friends, they battle with security guards
  and the school's "principal", eventually getting the main character, Piper, into
  serious trouble. After seeing what the adults do to Piper, the other kids band
  together to help her escape, an effort that poses serious risks for the rest
  of them should they fail. Personally, I am a huge fan of fantasy, especially
  normal people with incredible abililtes. However, I also love stories about
  places that turn out to be something completely different than what your first
  believed, so, basically, this book is right up my alley. If you're the type
  of person who enjoys fantasy along with a classic good-guy/bad-guy conflict,
  then you should enjoy this book as much as I do.</p>

<img src="The Billion Dollar Spy.jpg" class="left">
<p>Author: David Hoffman<br>Recommended Age: 12+</p>
<p class="review">I recently bought this book for my dad for father's day
  because he's a big reader and a total history geek. Then, I decided to read it
  for myself, and I was not disappointed. <i>The Billion Dollar Spy</i> is a
  non-fiction novel about a Russian government worker who turned into a spy for
  the American government during the Cold War. Over the course of
  several years, he secretly delivers information from hundreds of top-secret
  files concerning Soviet weapons systems to the American embassy in Moscow,
  fulfilling his wish of inflicting as much damage to the Soviet Union as possible
  in the shortest amount of time. Normally, I'm not much of a non-fiction person,
  but this book is basically the same as any other story that you'll read,
  except it's real. Plus, I love the suspense in this book. Every time the CIA
  meets with the spy, you can't help but wonder if something's going to go wrong,
  which keeps you interested. It does have a lot of history in it, so certain parts
  might not be as interesting as others, but overall, this story is pretty
  enthralling with a tragic ending that represents the difference between fiction
  and non-fiction. Despite this, I'd say that it's worth the read, and it really
  gives you an inside look into espionage operations that took place during Cold War.</p>

<p>Author: Richard Preston<br>Recommended Age: 14+
<p class="review">This book is definitely the best non-fiction book that I have
  ever read. Unfortunately, I don't read much non-fiction, so that's not saying
  much, but still, it' a really good book. This story about the outbreak of Ebola
  in the late 20th century gives a chilling view inside the research and
  experiments that lead to the discovery and exposure of the Ebola filoviruses.
  There is a perfect mix of gore, mystery, and emotional distress which all combine
  to make an incredibly disturbing, but fascinating, account of the mass scare
  that spread to the US, nearly creating an event of mass casualty. Even if you're
  not big into scary stories, this book is a great way to introduce yourself to
  non-fiction, because it provides a thriller that sounds like it's made up, but,
  unfortunately, is very real. So, if you're looking for something to get your
  heart racing and your nerves on-edge, give this book a try. It'll get your blood
  pumping for sure.</p><br>
